# Letter Tracing Game - Flutter App

This Flutter application is an educational game designed to help children learn how to write letters
by tracing. This implementation focuses on the letter "R" with validation for the two distinct
strokes required to write it.

## Features

- Interactive letter tracing for the letter "R"
- Two-stroke validation system:
    - First stroke: Vertical line from top to bottom
    - Second stroke: Curved head and diagonal leg
- Visual feedback during tracing
- Success/failure indication
- Progress tracking with visual indicators
- Retry functionality

## Project Structure

The project consists of four main Dart files:

1. `main.dart` - Entry point of the application
2. `letter_tracing_screen.dart` - Main UI and game logic
3. `letter_r_path.dart` - Path definitions for the letter "R"
4. `tracing_painter.dart` - Custom painter for rendering the letter and user strokes

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Flutter installed on your system.
2. Clone or download this repository.
3. Open the project in your IDE (e.g., VS Code, Android Studio).
4. Run `flutter pub get` to install dependencies.
5. Connect a device or start an emulator.
6. Run `flutter run` to launch the application.

## How to Play

1. The app displays the letter "R" with an outline.
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to trace each stroke:
    - First, trace the vertical line from top to bottom.
    - Then, trace the curved head and diagonal leg of the "R".
3. The app validates each stroke and provides visual feedback.
4. When both strokes are completed, you'll see a success or failure message.
5. Press "Try Again" to restart the game.

## Technical Implementation

The app uses Flutter's custom painting capabilities to create both the letter outlines and to track
the user's finger movements. The validation logic checks if the user's strokes are within an
acceptable proximity to the expected paths.

## Extensibility

The code is designed to be easily extended to support additional letters:

- The `LetterRPath` class can be generalized to support multiple letters
- The tracing logic can be adapted for different stroke requirements
- The UI components are modular and can be reused
